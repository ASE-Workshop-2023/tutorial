# Open Science with ASE Tutorials 2023

Repository for the workshop core tutorial materials. You can make changes to the gh-pages branch directly. Github actions will build the html and deploy automatically.

This repository is based on [The Carpentries template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template). 
If you would like to create a website in a similar style 
you most likely want to use that as a starting point.
