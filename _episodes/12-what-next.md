### There are many features of ASE we have not yet explored

- If you still have time, there is a bit of extra material on the [next page](../13-extras/index.html)
- There are some nice resources which compliment what we have covered in this tutorial:
	- [ASE website tutorials](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/tutorials/tutorials.html)
      - The [ASE database](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/tutorials/tut06_database/database.html) is especially relevant to this workshop, providing ways to share data and manage large sets of automated calculations.
	- [CAMD summer school (GPAW) tutorials](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/summerschools/summerschool22/summerschool22.html)
    - [The main GPAW tutorials](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/tutorialsexercises/tutorialsexercises.html)
	- Some tutorials are still accessible from the 2019 workshop at Chalmers University of Technology:
      - [Crystal symmetry and spglib](https://ajjackson.github.io/ase-tutorial-symmetry/)
      - [Cluster expansions with icet](https://ase-workshop.materialsmodeling.org/tutorials/icet/)
      - [Force constant extration with hiphive](https://ase-workshop.materialsmodeling.org/tutorials/hiphive/)
    - The research paper describing ASE: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-648X/aa680e

### There are ways to ask for help

- Often the quickest way to get help from ASE developers and users is the `#ase` channel on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!JEiuNJLuxedbohAOuH:matrix.org); this chat environment is convenient to access via the [Element](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ase:matrix.org) web client.
- There is also a traditional email [mailing list](https://listserv.fysik.dtu.dk/mailman/listinfo/ase-users).
- There is an [ASE forum](https://matsci.org/c/ase/36) on the [Materials Science Community Forum](https://matsci.org/). The ASE forum is not very active at the moment, but with a few more users that might change...
- If you have found a problem with the code, have a detailed feature request or other development-related issue to raise, the [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase/-/issues) issue tracker is the appropriate place to raise it.

### ASE is a community project

- ASE is an open source project that depends on community contribution
  - Good projects should provide information about how to contribute: [here are the relevant ASE docs](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/development/development.html)
- Not all contributions need to be code! Improvements to documentation and examples are useful.
- More code does also mean more bugs and more maintenance. Liberty is good Free beer is popular. Free puppies are... complicated.
- With this in mind, some of the best code contributions are unit tests!
- As you explore the ASE modules you will probably find useful tools that are in need of a good tutorial.

### If you find ASE useful in your research, please cite accordingly

- A link to citation information is [here](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/faq.html#how-should-i-cite-ase).
