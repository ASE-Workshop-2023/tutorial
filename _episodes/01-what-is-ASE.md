## ASE is a Python library for atomistic modelling

ASE is Python library for _atomistic modelling_; systems are fundamentally described by a set of atomic positions, and calculations are derived from these.

## The `Atoms` class is used to represent molecules and materials

When working with ASE molecules and materials are represented by the `Atoms` class. 

TODO: describe here some OOP terminology: class, object, instance, method, function.

## The `Calculator` class calculates basic properties of an `Atoms` object

## ASE plays nicely with a variety of atomistic modelling tools
