	- ASE website tutorials
	- [CAMD summer school tutorials](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/summerschools/summerschool22/summerschool22.html)
	- Paper associated with ASE: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-648X/aa680e

### There are ways to ask for help

- If problem with code: when and how to raise a Gitlab issue
- Discussion board or similar?
- Materials science discussion boards?
- Is there an ASE mailing list or similar

### ASE welcomes contributions

- Need some input from developers here...
- ASE is an open source project that depends on community contributions
- Not all contributions need to be code!
- Not all code contributions can be accepted - make clear scope and expectations
- Promote Hackathons
