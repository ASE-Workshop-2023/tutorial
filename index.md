> ## Preparation and pre-requisites
> To participate in the tutorials at the 
> <a href="{{ site.ase_workshop }}">Open Science with Atomic Simulation Environment</a>
> workshop you will need an up-to-date web browser 
> (we recommend Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) and
> access to the internet. 
> The latter will be provided via the eduroam service. 
> If you have problems accessing eduroam, 
> please contact the workshop organisers and alternative
> arrangements will be made.
>
> If you want to run this tutorial on your own computer
> then please see the [Setup instructions].
> 
> This tutorial assumes that you have no prior knowledge of ASE; it is
> aimed at complete beginners. We do assume you have basic familiarity with
> Python, Jupyter Notebooks and Numpy. If you need a refresher on any of 
> these tools we recommend the 
> <a href="{{ site.swc_python_site }}">Programming with Python</a> 
> Software Carpentry course.

> Throughout the tutorial you will see references to [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

> [Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/).
